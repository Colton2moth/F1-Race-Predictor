**User**

I'm working on a machine learning project where the goal is to use the fast f1 api and scikit learn to predict the top three drivers of a formula one race(not the order just the top three). I want you to act as a project manager and assistant for this. Do not write any code for me, instead, just give me directions and help where needed.

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you manage this F1 race prediction project! Let me first understand your current setup and then provide strategic guidance.


Perfect! I can see you have a good foundation started. Based on your testing notebook and project structure, here's my strategic guidance as your project manager:

## **Project Overview & Strategy**

**Goal**: Predict the top 3 drivers (not order) for F1 races using FastF1 API and scikit-learn

**Key Insight**: This is a **multi-label classification problem** where each driver can be classified as "in top 3" (1) or "not in top 3" (0).

## **Phase 1: Data Strategy & Architecture**

### **Data Sources to Consider:**
1. **Practice Sessions** (FP1, FP2, FP3) - Driver pace and consistency
2. **Qualifying Results** - Grid position and qualifying pace
3. **Historical Race Results** - Driver performance patterns
4. **Car Performance Data** - Team/driver combinations
5. **Track-Specific Data** - Circuit characteristics
6. **Weather Conditions** - Impact on performance
7. **Driver Form** - Recent performance trends

### **Feature Engineering Priorities:**
1. **Qualifying Position** (strongest predictor)
2. **Practice Session Times** (consistency and pace)
3. **Historical Performance** at the specific track
4. **Team Performance** trends
5. **Driver Experience** at the circuit

## **Phase 2: Implementation Roadmap**

### **Step 1: Data Acquisition Module**
- Create functions to fetch multiple seasons of data
- Focus on recent seasons (2020-2024) for relevance
- Implement caching strategy (you already have this started)

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
- Calculate driver consistency metrics from practice sessions
- Create historical performance features
- Engineer team-based features
- Normalize lap times across different sessions

### **Step 3: Model Development**
- Start with **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** (good for this type of problem)
- Consider **ensemble methods** combining multiple models
- Use **stratified sampling** to handle class imbalance

### **Step 4: Validation Strategy**
- Use **time-series cross-validation** (don't predict past with future data)
- Test on recent seasons (2023-2024)
- Track precision/recall for top-3 predictions

## **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Expand your data acquisition** to multiple races/seasons
2. **Create a feature engineering pipeline** 
3. **Build a baseline model** using qualifying position only
4. **Establish evaluation metrics** (accuracy, precision, recall for top-3)

## **Questions for You:**

1. **Scope**: Do you want to predict for all races or focus on specific circuits?
2. **Time Horizon**: How far in advance do you want to make predictions? (After qualifying? After practice?)
3. **Data Range**: How many seasons of historical data should we use?
4. **Evaluation**: What's more important - predicting all 3 correctly, or getting 2 out of 3?

Would you like me to help you prioritize which of these steps to tackle first, or do you have specific questions about any of these areas?

**User**

1. The goal will be for the features of the model to be laptimes for fp1, fp2, fp3, and qualies, as well as the circuit, so that the model can see which times are most likely to lead to a podium finish. I believe that the best option for this would be a random forest model.

2. The goal would be to be able to enter the practice and qualies times for each driver, then have it tell me who is most likely to place on the podium

3. I was thinking that it would be best to use data from the last 5 seasons as the cars have remained relatively similar

4. Not sure, what do you think would be better?

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! Your approach is very well thought out. Let me provide strategic guidance based on your specifications:

## **Project Strategy Refinement**

### **Feature Set (Perfect Choice!)**
Your feature selection is spot-on:
- **FP1, FP2, FP3 lap times** - Shows driver/team pace development
- **Qualifying times** - Critical predictor for race performance
- **Circuit** - Essential for track-specific patterns

This gives you a **5-dimensional feature vector** per driver per race, which is ideal for a Random Forest.

### **Model Architecture Decision**
**Random Forest is indeed the best choice** for this problem because:
- Handles mixed data types (times + categorical circuit names)
- Naturally handles feature interactions
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Robust to outliers in lap times
- Good for multi-class classification

### **Data Strategy (5 Seasons = Smart)**
Using 2020-2024 is perfect because:
- Cars have been relatively stable
- Enough data for robust training (~100 races)
- Recent enough to be relevant
- Avoids major regulation changes

### **Evaluation Metric Recommendation**
I recommend **prioritizing "getting 2 out of 3 correct"** over "predicting all 3 perfectly" because:
- F1 is inherently unpredictable (crashes, mechanical failures, strategy)
- 2/3 accuracy is more realistic and still valuable
- You can use **Top-3 Precision** as your primary metric

## **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Data Collection (Next Priority)**
1. **Create a data collection script** that loops through 2020-2024 seasons
2. **Extract fastest lap times** from each session for each driver
3. **Handle missing data** (drivers who didn't participate in all sessions)
4. **Create a unified dataset** with columns: `[driver, circuit, fp1_time, fp2_time, fp3_time, quali_time, podium_finish]`

### **Phase 2: Feature Engineering**
1. **Normalize lap times** (convert to seconds, handle outliers)
2. **Create derived features**:
   - Time improvement from FP1→FP2→FP3→Quali
   - Consistency metrics (standard deviation of times)
   - Relative performance (time gap to fastest in each session)

### **Phase 3: Model Development**
1. **Baseline model**: Use only qualifying times
2. **Full model**: Include all practice sessions
3. **Feature importance analysis**: See which sessions matter most

## **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Start with data collection** - Create a script to gather 5 seasons of data
2. **Focus on one circuit first** (like Australian GP) to test your pipeline
3. **Create a simple baseline** using just qualifying times

## **Questions for Implementation:**

1. **Missing Data Strategy**: How should we handle drivers who miss sessions (DNS, DNF, etc.)?
2. **Time Format**: Should we use absolute lap times or relative to session fastest?
3. **Driver Identification**: Use driver numbers or names for consistency across seasons?

Would you like me to help you design the data collection strategy first, or do you have questions about any of these implementation details?

---

**User**

1. Not sure, how do you think I should do it?

2. My thought was to just use each drivers fastest time from each session, but if you have a better idea, let me know

3. I assumed that the driver name wouldnt matter since we're just looking at the times compared to the result

---

**Cursor**

Great questions! Let me provide strategic guidance on each:

## **1. Missing Data Strategy**

**Recommended Approach: Exclude incomplete entries**
- If a driver misses any session (FP1, FP2, FP3, or Quali), exclude that driver from that race
- This ensures data quality and prevents the model from learning from incomplete patterns
- You'll still have plenty of data (most drivers complete all sessions)

**Alternative: Imputation (not recommended for this use case)**
- Could fill missing times with average times, but this might introduce bias
- Since you want to predict based on actual performance, incomplete data should be excluded

## **2. Time Format Strategy**

**Your instinct is correct - use fastest times from each session!** Here's why:

**Fastest Time Approach (Recommended):**
- ✅ Captures peak performance potential
- ✅ Eliminates traffic/strategy noise
- ✅ Most relevant for predicting race pace
- ✅ Easier to interpret

**Alternative Approaches (not recommended for your goal):**
- Average times: Could be skewed by traffic, setup changes
- Median times: Less representative of true pace
- All lap times: Would create massive datasets and complexity

## **3. Driver Identification**

**You're absolutely right!** Driver names don't matter because:
- You're predicting based on **performance patterns**, not driver identity
- The model learns "what lap times lead to podiums" regardless of who drives
- This makes the model more generalizable

**Recommended approach:**
- Use driver numbers for consistency
- Treat each driver-race combination as an independent data point
- The model learns: "If someone posts these times, they're likely to podium"

## **Refined Data Structure**

Your final dataset should look like:
```
[circuit, fp1_fastest, fp2_fastest, fp3_fastest, quali_fastest, podium_finish]
```

## **Implementation Priority**

1. **Start with data collection** - Gather fastest times for all sessions
2. **Create a simple baseline** - Use only qualifying times first
3. **Add practice sessions** - See if they improve predictions
4. **Test on recent races** - Validate your approach

## **Next Steps:**

Would you like me to help you:
1. **Design the data collection script** to gather 5 seasons of fastest times?
2. **Create a baseline model** using just qualifying data first?
3. **Set up the evaluation framework** to test your predictions?

Which would be most helpful to tackle first?

[circuit, fp1_fastest, fp2_fastest, fp3_fastest, quali_fastest, podium_finish]
```

**User**

Great. Let's move on with the project

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Let's get started with the project. Based on our strategy discussion, here's what we should tackle first:

## **Phase 1: Data Collection Strategy**

### **Immediate Goal**: Create a robust data collection system

**What you need to build:**
1. **Data acquisition script** that can fetch 5 seasons (2020-2024) of data
2. **Handle all F1 circuits** from those seasons
3. **Extract fastest lap times** from FP1, FP2, FP3, and Qualifying
4. **Create a clean dataset** ready for modeling

### **Key Challenges to Consider:**
- **Session availability**: Not all races have all practice sessions
- **Driver participation**: Some drivers miss sessions or races
- **Data consistency**: Different circuits, different seasons
- **Caching strategy**: You already have this started

## **Recommended Implementation Order:**

### **Step 1: Start Small**
- Begin with **one season** (2023) and **one circuit** (Australian GP)
- Test your data extraction logic
- Make sure you can get all the features you need

### **Step 2: Scale Up**
- Expand to all circuits in 2023
- Then add 2022, 2021, 2020, 2024
- Handle edge cases and missing data

### **Step 3: Data Validation**
- Check data quality and completeness
- Ensure your features are properly formatted

## **Questions to Guide Your Implementation:**

1. **Do you want to start with the data acquisition script first?**
2. **Should we begin with a single race to test the approach?**
3. **Are you comfortable with the FastF1 API structure from your testing notebook?**

## **What I Can Help With:**
- **Architecture decisions** for your data collection
- **Error handling strategies** for missing data
- **Data structure design** for your final dataset
- **Validation approaches** to ensure data quality

**What would you like to tackle first?** Should we start with the data collection script, or do you have questions about the approach?

**User**

Can you take a look at my apitesting notebook?

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! I can see your API testing notebook is working well. Here's my analysis:

## **What's Working Great:**

### **✅ Data Access Strategy**
- Your caching setup is perfect for large-scale data collection
- You're successfully loading all session types (FP1, FP2, FP3, Q, R)
- The `groupby('DriverNumber')['LapTime'].min()` approach is exactly what we need

### **✅ Data Structure Understanding**
- You've identified the key data sources: `session.laps` and `session.results`
- You're correctly extracting fastest lap times per driver
- You've created the podium classification logic

### **✅ Foundation for Scaling**
- The pattern you've established can be easily extended to multiple races/seasons

## **Key Insights from Your Testing:**

### **Data Quality Observations:**
- All 20 drivers participated in most sessions
- Some drivers had missing data (like driver 2 in FP2)
- The data structure is consistent across sessions

### **Ready for Production:**
Your testing shows you have the core functionality needed for the full data collection system.

## **Next Steps - Building on Your Foundation:**

### **1. Create Reusable Functions**
Extract your working code into functions:
- `get_session_data(year, circuit, session_type)`
- `extract_fastest_times(session)`
- `get_race_results(session)`

### **2. Handle Edge Cases**
- Missing drivers in certain sessions
- Different session availability across circuits
- Data validation and error handling

### **3. Scale to Multiple Races**
- Loop through circuits and seasons
- Create a unified dataset structure

## **Questions for You:**

1. **Are you ready to start building the production data collection system?**
2. **Should we start by creating functions from your working code?**
3. **Do you want to test with a few more races first, or jump into the full 5-season collection?**

Your testing shows you have a solid foundation - we can now build the scalable system on top of this!

**User**

Alright I think we should get started on number 1. But first, could you just give me the structure of how this is all going to work?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Let me give you the complete system architecture and data flow structure:

## **System Architecture Overview**

### **Data Flow Structure:**

```
1. DATA COLLECTION LAYER
   ├── Season Loop (2020-2024)
   ├── Circuit Loop (all circuits per season)
   ├── Session Loop (FP1, FP2, FP3, Q, R)

**User**

1. Seems pretty straightforward

2. Sounds good

3. Don't think so

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Let's start building the core functions. Based on your working notebook, here's what we should create first:

## **Phase 1: Core Functions Development**

### **Function 1: `extract_fastest_times(session)`**
This will extract the fastest lap time for each driver in a given session.

**What you need to build:**
- Take a session object (like your `fp1`, `fp2`, etc.)
- Return fastest lap times per driver
- Handle cases where drivers have no valid laps

### **Function 2: `get_podium_finishers(race_session)`**
This will identify which drivers finished on the podium.

**What you need to build:**
- Take a race session object
- Return list of driver numbers who finished 1st, 2nd, 3rd
- Handle edge cases (disqualifications, etc.)

### **Function 3: `process_race(year, circuit)`**
This will combine all session data for one race.

**What you need to build:**
- Load all sessions (FP1, FP2, FP3, Q, R)
- Extract fastest times from each
- Get podium finishers
- Create unified dataset for that race

## **Implementation Strategy:**

### **Start with Function 1:**
- Extract the working code from your notebook
- Make it reusable for any session type
- Add error handling for missing data

### **Then Function 2:**
- Use your existing podium logic
- Make it robust for different race scenarios

### **Finally Function 3:**
- Combine everything into one race processor
- Test with Australian GP 2023 first

## **Questions to Guide Your Implementation:**

1. **Should we start with `extract_fastest_times()` first?**
2. **Do you want to work in the `src/data_acquisition.py` file?**
3. **Should we test each function individually as we build them?**

## **What I Can Help With:**
- **Function signatures** and parameter design
- **Error handling strategies** for each function
- **Testing approaches** to validate your functions
- **Data structure decisions** for return values

**Ready to start with the first function?** Which one would you like to tackle first?
